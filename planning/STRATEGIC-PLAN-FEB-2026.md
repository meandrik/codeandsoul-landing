# CODE&SOUL Strategic Plan
## Path to First $6-12k Sale by March 1st, 2026

*Created by Gary 🦉 | February 3, 2026 (Night Review)*

---

## Executive Summary

**Goal:** Close first paying client ($6-12k) within 26 days

**Core Insight:** We've built excellent brand infrastructure, but we haven't created a direct path to revenue. Content alone won't close a $6-12k deal fast enough — we need proactive outbound.

**Strategy:** Parallel execution of content (Gary) + direct outreach (Dima/Viktoriia) + sales infrastructure (landing page, booking, payment).

---

## Current State Assessment

### ✅ What We Have (Strengths)

| Asset | Status | Notes |
|-------|--------|-------|
| Gary's LinkedIn | Live | 1 post, 4 reactions, 38 impressions |
| Brand Identity | Complete | Logo, colors (Navy/Gold), brand book |
| Landing Page Content | Ready | 12 header variations, content structure in Notion |
| Content Strategy | Defined | 60% pain, 25% tech, 15% offers |
| Team | Aligned | Dima (tech), Viktoriia (sales), Gary (content) |
| Tech Stack | Ready | Flux Pro, n8n, various AI tools |
| Social Presence | Partial | LinkedIn, YouTube, Instagram, TikTok, Threads |

### ❌ What's Missing (Gaps)

| Gap | Impact | Priority |
|-----|--------|----------|
| No live website | Can't send traffic anywhere | HIGH |
| No booking system | Can't capture interested leads | HIGH |
| No outreach system | Can't proactively find ICPs | HIGH |
| No case studies | Limited social proof | MEDIUM |
| Limited network | Gary has 1 connection | MEDIUM |
| No payment system | Can't close deals | HIGH |

### 🎯 Target Client ("Alex Morgan")

- **Role:** Founder, Managing Partner, CEO
- **Company:** Boutique consultancy/advisory firm
- **Size:** 5-50 employees
- **Revenue:** €500k-€5M
- **Pain:** Knows content drives leads, but hates filming and has no time
- **Behavior:** Active on LinkedIn, posts occasionally, not doing video
- **Budget:** Can afford $6-12k for a done-for-you solution

---

## The Brutal Truth

With 26 days to first sale, we must:

1. **Stop building, start selling** — Brand is "good enough" now
2. **Find 100 Alex Morgans** — Can't sell to people we haven't found
3. **Start conversations** — B2B sales happen in conversations, not from content
4. **Have a sales process** — Diagnostic call → Proposal → Close

**What drives a $6-12k B2B sale:**
- Trust (do they believe we can deliver?)
- Fit (is this actually their problem?)
- Urgency (why now vs. later?)
- Conversation (not landing pages — real human dialogue)

---

## Optimal Strategy: Three Parallel Tracks

### Track 1: Sales Infrastructure (Days 1-3)
**Goal:** Be ready to take money

### Track 2: Prospect Hunting (Days 3-14)
**Goal:** Build list of 100 qualified ICPs + start conversations

### Track 3: Content Engine (Ongoing)
**Goal:** Build visibility and credibility to support outreach

---

## Detailed Execution Plan

### 🔧 Track 1: Sales Infrastructure

**Day 1-2 Deliverables:**

1. **Booking System**
   - Platform: Calendly or Cal.com (free tier works)
   - URL: calendly.com/codeandsoul or similar
   - Slot type: "Free Diagnostic Call" (15 min)
   - Availability: Dima/Viktoriia calendars synced
   - Automated confirmation + reminder emails

2. **Landing Page (Minimal Viable)**
   - Use V4 Premium header
   - Add: Pain section, Solution section, CTA section
   - Single CTA: Book Diagnostic Call
   - Deploy to: GitHub Pages → Custom domain later
   - **Don't over-engineer** — shipping beats perfect

3. **Payment Ready**
   - Stripe account (if not already)
   - Invoice template (Notion or dedicated tool)
   - Simple contract template
   - Bank account for receiving

4. **Proposal Template**
   - Word/Notion template
   - Sections: Understanding, Solution, Deliverables, Timeline, Investment
   - Two tiers: Base ($6k) and Pro ($10k)

### 🎯 Track 2: Prospect Hunting

**Day 3-7: Build the List**

**Search Criteria (LinkedIn):**
- Title: Founder, CEO, Managing Director, Partner, Owner
- Industry: Management Consulting, Professional Services, Business Consulting
- Company size: 2-50 employees
- Location: US, UK, Canada, Australia (English-speaking)

```

**Target: 100 names by Day 7**

**Day 7-21: Outreach Execution**

**The Warm Outreach Framework:**

```
Stage 1: CONNECT (Day 1)
- Send personalized connection request
- Note: Reference something specific about them
- Example: "Hi [Name], loved your post about [topic]. 
  Building something in the AI content space — would love to connect."

Stage 2: VALUE (Days 2-5)
- Like/comment on their content (genuine)
- Share something useful without asking for anything
- Build familiarity before pitching

Stage 3: CURIOSITY (Day 5-7)
- Soft mention of what we do
- Example: "Been working on AI avatar systems for founders 
  who want to post video without filming. Your content 
  on [topic] made me think you might find it interesting."

Stage 4: OFFER (Day 7-10)
- Offer free diagnostic call
- No pitch, no pressure
- Example: "Would you be open to a 15-min chat? 
  Happy to share what we've learned — no strings attached."
```

**Volume Targets:**
- Connection requests: 10/day
- Active conversations: 5-10 at any time
- Diagnostic calls: 2-3/week
