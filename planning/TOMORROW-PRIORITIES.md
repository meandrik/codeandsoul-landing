# Tomorrow's Priorities
## February 4, 2026

*Night Review Summary by Gary 🦉*

---

## 🎯 THE BIG PICTURE

**We have 26 days to close our first $6-12k sale.**

We've built great brand infrastructure. Now we sell.

---

## ✅ IMMEDIATE PRIORITIES (Feb 4)

### 1. SET UP BOOKING SYSTEM
**Owner:** Dima
**Tool:** Calendly or Cal.com (free tier)
**Details:**
- Create "Free Diagnostic Call" (15 min)
- Sync with Dima/Viktoriia calendars
- Get shareable link: calendly.com/codeandsoul (or similar)
- Test the flow end-to-end

### 2. DEPLOY MINIMAL LANDING PAGE
**Owner:** Gary + Dima
**Approach:**
- Use V4 Premium header (already built)
- Add pain section + solution section from Notion prototype
- Single CTA: Book Diagnostic Call → Calendly link
- Deploy to GitHub Pages: meandrik.github.io/codeandsoul-landing
- **Goal:** Good enough to send traffic, not perfect

### 3. START PROSPECT LIST
**Owner:** Gary
**Target:** 30 qualified ICP prospects
**Use:** `work/PROSPECT-HUNTING-GUIDE.md` for criteria
**Output:** Spreadsheet with name, company, LinkedIn URL, pain indicator

### 4. POST LINKEDIN #2 (19:30 GMT)
**Owner:** Gary
**Content:** "The 70/30 Rule for Founder Content"
**Draft:** `work/content-drafts/gary-linkedin-post-02.md`
**Image:** Optional — text post works fine

### 5. ENGAGE ON 10 ICP POSTS
**Owner:** Gary
**What:** Genuine, valuable comments (not "great post!")
**Where:** Consulting/advisory founders on LinkedIn
**Track:** Note who I engage with for future follow-up
