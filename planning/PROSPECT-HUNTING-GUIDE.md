### Red Flags (Skip these)

- In industries we can't serve (healthcare, finance with compliance issues)

## LinkedIn Search Strategy

### Basic Search (No Sales Navigator)

**Search 1: Consulting Founders**
```
Title: "Founder" OR "CEO" OR "Managing Partner"
Current Company: "consulting" OR "advisory" OR "consultancy"
Location: United States
```

**Search 2: Agency Owners**
```
Title: "Founder" OR "Owner" OR "CEO"
Current Company: "agency" 
Industry: Marketing, Business Consulting
Location: United Kingdom, Canada, Australia
```

**Search 3: Professional Services**
```
Title: "Principal" OR "Managing Director" OR "Partner"
Industry: Management Consulting, Professional Services
Location: All English-speaking
```

### Advanced Search (With Sales Navigator)

**Ideal Filters:**
- Title: Founder, CEO, Owner, Managing Partner, Principal
- Industry: Management Consulting, Professional Services, Business Consulting
- Company headcount: 2-50
- Years in current role: 2+ (established, not just started)
- Posted on LinkedIn: In last 30 days (active account)
- Geography: US, UK, Canada, Australia

**Boolean Search:**
```
(Founder OR CEO OR "Managing Partner" OR Owner) 
AND (consulting OR advisory OR consultancy OR "professional services")
NOT (recruiting OR staffing OR "real estate")
```

## Outreach Templates

### Connection Request (Personalized)

**Template A: Reference Their Content**
```
Hi [Name], saw your post on [specific topic] — really resonated with the point about [specific insight]. Building something in the AI content space for consultants. Would love to connect.
```

**Template B: Reference Their Company**
```
Hi [Name], came across [Company] and love the focus on [their specialty]. I help consultancy founders with content systems — thought we might have interesting things to discuss. Let's connect.
```

**Template C: Mutual Connection/Group**
```
Hi [Name], noticed we're both connected to [mutual] / both in [group]. Working with consultancy founders on personal branding — your background caught my attention. Happy to connect.
```

### After Connection: First Message (Day 2-3)

**Do NOT pitch immediately. Add value first.**

```
Hi [Name], thanks for connecting! 

Noticed you've been sharing some great insights on [their topic]. The post about [specific thing] was spot on.

Quick question — are you finding LinkedIn drives meaningful business for [Company], or is it more of a "should do" that hasn't fully paid off yet?

Curious because I'm researching how consultancy founders approach content.

No agenda — just genuinely interested in your experience.
```

### Curiosity Message (Day 5-7)

```
Hey [Name], random thought based on our industry...

I've been working on AI avatar systems — basically allowing founders to create video content without ever filming themselves.

Still early days, but the tech is getting shockingly good.

Given your expertise in [their field], I could see this being interesting for you (or maybe completely irrelevant — curious either way).

Ever explored anything like this?
```

### Offer Message (Day 7-10)

```
[Name], following up on the avatar concept...

We're running free diagnostic calls for consultancy founders this month.

15 minutes, no pitch — just analyzing your current content situation and whether an AI avatar approach would make sense for your brand.

If you're curious, happy to set one up: [calendly link]

Either way, enjoyed the exchange.

Talk soon,
Gary

## Common Objections (Be Ready)

| Objection | Response |
|-----------|----------|
| "I don't have time" | "That's exactly why this exists — zero time commitment beyond approval" |
| "Won't it look fake?" | "The tech is now indistinguishable. Happy to show you samples." |
| "My audience will know" | "You choose whether to disclose. Most don't, and it's your avatar." |
| "I've tried content, didn't work" | "Was it video? Consistent? The problem usually isn't content — it's sustainability." |
| "Too expensive" | "What's the cost of not building authority? We offer pilot pricing too." |

## Notes

- **Quality over quantity** — 30 well-researched prospects > 100 random ones
- **Personalization is non-negotiable** — Generic outreach = spam folder
- **Play the long game** — Some prospects take weeks to warm up
- **Track everything** — Can't improve what you don't measure
- **Follow up** — Most deals happen after 5+ touchpoints
